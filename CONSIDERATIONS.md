# Technical Considerations & Future Roadmap

This document outlines the key assumptions made during development, scalability considerations, and planned future enhancements for the ToDo application.

## Assumptions

### Single-User Focus

- **Primary assumption**: Each user operates independently with their own task lists, i.e. there are to be no multi-user tasks.
- **Rationale**: Simplified initial implementation and clear security boundaries
- **Impact**: Database design and UI optimized for individual productivity over collaboration

### Technology Constraints

- **Database**: SQLite - simplicity and portability
  - Assumption: < 1M tasks total across all users
  - Single-writer limitation acceptable for current scale
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with 7-day expiry
  - Assumption: Users will not need or want > 7-day sessions on app
  - No refresh token implementation (trades security for simplicity)
- **Frontend State**: In-memory state management
  - Assumption: Browser sessions are relatively short-lived
  - No offline persistence beyond authentication tokens

### User Behavior Assumptions

- **Task Volume**: Individual users will have < 1,000 active tasks
- **Concurrent Users**: < 100 simultaneous active users during MVP stage
- **Data Patterns**: More reads than writes (roughly estimated 10:1 ratio)
- **Geographic Distribution**: Single region deployment for MVP

### Business Logic Assumptions

- **Soft Deletes**: Users prefer data recovery over permanent deletion
- **Due Dates**: Optional and used primarily for prioritization
- **Tags**: Simple string-based categorization sufficient
- **Task Relationships**: Flat task structure (no subtasks or dependencies)

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Bottlenecks

#### Database Layer

- **SQLite Limitations**:
  - Single writer bottleneck
  - No built-in replication
  - File-level locking
  - Limited concurrent connections (~1000)

#### Application Layer

- **In-Memory Session State**: Server restarts lose all session data
- **Synchronous Processing**: All operations blocking
- **Single Instance**: No horizontal scaling capability

#### Frontend

- **Client-Side Pagination**: Limited to current page sorting/filtering
- **No Caching**: Every action requires server round-trip
- **Bundle Size**: All code loaded upfront

### Scaling Strategies

#### Database Migration (1K - 10K users)

**PostgreSQL Migration**:

- Connection pooling (100-500 concurrent connections)
- Read replicas for scaling queries
- Proper indexing strategy
- Query optimization

**Benefits**:

- 10x improvement in concurrent user capacity
- Better query performance for complex filters
- Horizontal read scaling

#### Caching Layer (10K - 100K users)

**Redis Implementation**:

- Session storage
- Frequently accessed task lists
- User preference caching
- Rate limiting counters

**Benefits**:

- Reduction in database load for frequently accessed data
- Sub-100ms response times
- Better (lower latency) user experience during high load

#### Microservices Architecture (100K+ users)

**Service Decomposition**:

- Authentication Service
- Task Management Service
- Notification Service (if required, e.g. soon-due, past-due, etc.)
- Analytics Service

**Infrastructure**:

- Container orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Service mesh (Istio)
- Message queues (RabbitMQ/Azure Service Bus)

#### Global Distribution (1M+ users)

**Multi-Region Deployment**:

- CDN for static assets
- Regional database replicas
- Edge computing for API responses
- Data sovereignty compliance
